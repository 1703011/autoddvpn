如何debug系統autoddvpn的運作狀態？

= Details =
您需要ssh進入DD-WRT， 並且查看/tmp/autoddvpn.log， 內容如下：

{{{
root@DD-WRT:/tmp# tail -f autoddvpn.log 
[DEBUG] failed to get PPTPDEV, retry in 3 seconds
[DEBUG] failed to get PPTPDEV, retry in 3 seconds
[DEBUG] failed to get PPTPDEV, retry in 3 seconds

[INFO] got PPTPDEV as ppp0, set into nvram
[INFO] got PPTPGW as 192.168.199.1 , set into nvram
[INFO] VPN is UP, trying to modify the routing table
[INFO] delete default gw 192.168.172.254
[INFO] add default gw 192.168.199.1 
[INFO] adding the static routes, this may teke a while.
[INFO] final check the default gw
[DEBUG] my current gw is 192.168.199.1
[INFO] static routes added
[DEBUG] return 0
[DEBUG] break
}}}

或者也可以在DD-WRT的web管理界面的命令輸入框打 * cat /tmp/autoddvpn.log * 然後按下Run Command, 也會傳回LOG記錄。
